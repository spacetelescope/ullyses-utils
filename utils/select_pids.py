def select_all_pids(massive=False, tts=False, extra=True, monitoring=True, single_list=True):
    '''Use this function if you want to select more than one region's PIDs at once.
    The logic behind writing this is:
    1) if you want massive stars (LMC, SMC, lowz), specify massive=True. If you
    do not want the "extra" stars included in the ULLYSES sample (i.e. stars
    that were added after the original sample was created to fill the
    luminosity/class bins), then specify extra=False.
      -> Original sample + Extra sample: pids = select_all_pids(massive=True)
      -> Original sample only: pids = select_all_pids(massive=True, extra=False)
    2) if you want all regions of the t-tauri star sample, including the monitoring
    stars, specify tts=True. If you do not want the monitoring stars in the sample
    then specify monitoring=False.
      -> All TTS: pids = select_all_pids(tts=True)
      -> All TTS but the monitoring: pids = select_all_pids(tts=True, monitoring=False)
    3) You want the entire sample of everything.
      -> pids = select_all_pids()
    4) If you want some combination of massive stars without the extra sample
    *and* the TTS without the monitoring (or some combination), you can specify
    a combination of the above keywords. For example:
      -> pids = select_all_pids(massive=True, tts=True, extra=False)
    There is an additional keyword "single_list" that is set to True by default,
    which means you get a list of PIDs for both ULLYSES observed and archival
    datasets. If you would like those separated out, specify single_list=False,
    and the function will return a dictionary with the two lists separated out
    with the keys "ULLYSES" and "ARCHIVAL".

    Inputs
    -------
    massive : Boolean (default=False)
        Get massive stars (LMC, SMC, & Low-Z)
    tts : Boolean (default=False)
        Get all t-tauri stars
    extra : Boolean (default=True)
        should be used exclusively with "massive". Use to get the stars not
        originally included in the core ULLYSES sample.
    monitoring : Boolean (default=True)
        should be used exclusively with "tts". Use to get the monitoring stars.
    single_list : Boolean (default=True)
        By default, return both ULLYSES observed and archival samples together.
        If False, this will return a dictionary instead with the two lists of
        PIDs separated out under the keys "ULLYSES" and "ARCHIVAL"
