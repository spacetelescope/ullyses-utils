# We have two ways of indicating which exact exposures should be turned into a

# to use. For monitoring stars, it's easier to do the latter, but for
# serendipitous TSS, it's easier to do the former.

# You may specify either IPPPSS or IPPPSSOOT identifiers.
# You MUST use a dash+space, which tells yaml the value is actually part of a list.
